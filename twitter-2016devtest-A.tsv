6.27918208956281E+017	neutral	@_mindy_ @RetroUnited coz of Zlatan talking how he loves a fight. May make him show LVG just how he is truly world class.

6.30817148751979E+017	neutral	@nananavy That &amp; Zlatan insisting on playing through pain for the 2nd half vs. Lyon. Why not just come off? 2-0 up anyway.
6.3082097734615E+017	negative	Watching a replay of the PSG / Lille match from Friday. No Zlatan makes PSG unwatchable.
6.31192740089311E+017	neutral	@Jon_LeGossip Any truth to Galatasaray having made an informal offer to PSG for Zlatan? Is he fit to play this Sunday?
6.32604790720217E+017	negative	@ACMilanNorway anyway, telling Zlatan he'll be the center of the team is like telling the sun it's the center of the solar system. No crap.
6.32806342382653E+017	positive	7 more days till we start the campaign that will win us our 19th scudetto ! Zlatan or no Zlatan that trophy is ours. #ForzaMilan

6.35166727651856E+017	positive	Zlatan is simply saving himself for the 2nd leg
6.35179934365942E+017	positive	@DaveEllis11 @klavierstuk but if Zlatan is available for a reasonable fee, it may well be worth going for, for an immediate solution.
6.35220412155105E+017	neutral	@LiLHammy97 we may have the slimmest of chances cuz of De Gea. But not enough time rather try for Griezmann. Wont mind Zlatan for a year !
6.35924485753991E+017	negative	The top 4 strikers in the world are not for sale and our coach can't handle the 5th (Zlatan)
6.36025757672821E+017	positive	I would love to have cavani man. He's over shawdowed and played 2nd fiddle to Zlatan he would shine at arsenal
6.36255247992758E+017	neutral	@Jon_LeGossip I didn't think they will sell either. Maybe Rabiot but surely Cavani doesn't want to play 2nd fiddle to Zlatan anymore
6.37623077304668E+017	positive	Zlatan wears sunglasses so his eyes do not harm the sun.

6.38018562334917E+017	positive	Wonder if Zlatan will be a United player come Tuesday night, think he may be the only realistic option of a big name signing.
6.38090040254575E+017	negative	If there is a silver lining this shows LVG if we dont buy anyone b4 Tuesday we is fucked!! Fuck it i would take Zlatan!!

6.40276909633487E+017	neutral	Rib injury for Zlatan against Russia is a big blow if he misses Austria game Tuesday. A chance for new Sunderland striker Toivonen #SAFC
6.40296841725235E+017	neutral	Noooooo! I was hoping to see Zlatan being Zlatan in Tuesday! Oh well, still looking forward to the match.  https://t.co/swGyd9cQAJ
